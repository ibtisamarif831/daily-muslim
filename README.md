## Database Setup

This project uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) for the database layer.

### Development

1. **Generate migrations** after schema changes:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   ```

2. **Apply migrations locally**:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate:local
   ```

3. **Open Drizzle Studio** to view/edit data:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:studio
   ```

### Production

1. **Apply migrations to production**:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

### Environment Variables

For production deployments that need to run migrations, create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your Cloudflare account details:
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
- `CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN`: API token with D1 edit permissions

### Database Schema

The current schema includes:
- **Users**: User accounts with email authentication
- **Tasks**: User tasks with completion tracking
- **Prayers**: Daily prayer tracking for Muslim users

Check `app/db/schema.ts` for the complete schema definition.n Cloudflare Workers
